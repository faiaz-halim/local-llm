# LangGraph RAG Agent with Llama3 - Local Setup

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook designed to demonstrate how to build and run a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent using a local instance of the Llama3 model and the LangGraph framework.

## Overview

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful method that combines the strengths of information retrieval systems with large language models (LLMs) to enhance the capabilities of natural language understanding and generation. This notebook uses a local instance of the Llama3 model, integrated with LangGraph, to build an intelligent agent that can retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base and use it to generate high-quality responses.

The key components of this project include:
- **LangGraph**: A framework used to define and run language agents that interact with both structured and unstructured data.
- **Llama3**: A powerful local language model that handles text generation tasks.
- **RAG Architecture**: Combines retrieval of relevant data with Llama3 to answer user queries with enhanced precision.

## Features

- **Local LLM Deployment**: Set up a local instance of the Llama3 model, ensuring privacy and control over your data.
- **RAG Framework**: Integrate a retrieval-based approach to fetch relevant documents before generating responses.
- **Agent Configuration**: Customize the agent's behavior, allowing it to handle diverse tasks such as answering questions or providing summaries based on the retrieved data.
- **Modular Design**: The notebook is structured to allow easy customization and extension, enabling users to modify various components as per their requirements.
  
## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/faiaz-halim/local-llm.git
    cd local-llm
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    The notebook relies on several Python packages. To install them, use the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
    Launch the Jupyter notebook server:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    Open the `langgraph_rag_agent_llama3_local.ipynb` notebook and follow the instructions to run each cell step by step.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**: Make sure you have Python installed. If not, you can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **GPU (optional)**: For faster performance, a machine with GPU support is recommended.
- **Llama3 Model**: The notebook downloads and runs a local instance of the Llama3 model, but you can also bring your own weights or integrate other models.

## Customization

- **Custom Knowledge Base**: You can replace the default retrieval dataset with your own documents or knowledge base.
- **Fine-tuning Llama3**: If needed, you can fine-tune the Llama3 model on your specific datasets.
- **Agent Logic**: Modify the agent logic to customize how it interacts with the LLM and the retrieval system.

## Use Cases

- **Question Answering**: Build an agent that answers questions based on a specific knowledge base.
- **Document Summarization**: Retrieve relevant documents and summarize them using Llama3.
- **Information Retrieval**: Use the retrieval component to fetch contextually relevant information from a large dataset.
